## Documentation for Activity 0.5 Single Page App

### Assignment:
> Create a diagram depicting the situation where the user goes to the single page app version of the notes app at https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/spa.

### Step 1:
The initial first requests are the same.  
The browser will request all of the initial files to set up the page.  
This time, the js file is spa.js.


> browser->server: HTTP GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/spa    
> server-->browser: HTML-code (document skeleton)    
> browser->server: HTTP GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/main.css    
> server-->browser: main.css (stylesheet for page formatting)    
> browser->server: HTTP GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/spa.js    
> server-->browser: spa.js (script that dictates desired page behavior)   
> browser->server: HTTP GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/data.json  
> server-->browser: data.json (all of the previous notes that have been logged)  

### Step 2:
Now, when the user adds and saves
a note, instead of refreshing the
whole page, only one request is sent
to add the new not as json data. 


> browser->server: HTTP POST https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/new_note_spa  
> server-->browser: data.json (only for the new note instead of all prev notes as well)  

### Step 3:
Unlike the previous example, 
there is no redirect.  
The browser stays on the same page.
